# <%= app_name.humanize %>

This is [Solidus](https://solidus.io/) eCommerce application.

## Development Setup

1. Clone the repo:

  ```
  $ cd ~/Code
  $ git clone git@github.com:nebulab/<%= app_name.humanize %>.git
  $ cd <%= app_name.humanize %>
  ```

2. Install dependencies and prepare database:

  ```
  $ ./bin/setup
  ```

3. You're up and running. Just start foreman:

  ```
  $ bundle exec invoker start invoker.ini
  ```

Notes:

* Make sure you have PostgreSQL and Redis up and running
* Seeds include a user that developer can use locally to login:

  ```
  Email: admin@example.com
  Psw:   test123
  ```

## <%= app_name.humanize %> basic development style guide

1. *Always* create separate branches and pull requests for adding/removing/changing code;
2. Write feature and unit specs as needed and respect project guidelines (code coverange, quality metrics, ...);
3. Use imperative commit messages with capitalized first letter (eg. "Add this feature" instead
of "adds this feature"). Use descriptive commits (with both title and description) and respect title length;
4. If we are working on a new feature, it's better to create seed data for the models we are working on to
let other devs reproduce behavior or eventual issues with these;
5. When porting some code from Solidus please use a separate commit referring to the original code you're porting
with a link to the Solidus GH project;
6. Please refer to [GitHub Ruby Styleguide](https://github.com/styleguide/ruby) when writing Ruby code.

## Running tests

<%= app_name.humanize %> is covered with basic fuctional tests using Rspec, FactoryGirl and Capybara (the same tools used by Solidus).
Javascript tests are run via Selenium ChromeDriver so you'll need to install _Chrome_ first (which is required).

To run the test suite run:

  ```
  $ rake db:test:prepare
  $ rspec spec
  ```

Please aim to full test coverage.

## Deploying <%= app_name.humanize %>

Deploys depend on the app's configuration and can change from app to app. When in doubt ask [mtylty](https://github.com/mtylty).
