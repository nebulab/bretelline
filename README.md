# Bretelline

This is [Nebulab][nebulab]'s own Rails (mainly Solidus) application template.

The strange name actually Italian for *little suspenders*. The idea for this gem
came up because we need something like [Suspenders][suspenders].

## Installation

Install it as a standalone gem:

```
  $ gem install bretelline
```

## Usage

Run the gem as you would with `rails new <app_name>`:

```
  $ bretelline <app_name>
```
